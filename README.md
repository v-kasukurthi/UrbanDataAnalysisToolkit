# UrbanDataAnalysisToolkit
The code parses crime data from CSV files, calculates crime rates by year and neighborhood, and correlates them with factors like vacant building notices and rehabilitation efforts. Through statistical tests and visualizations, it aims to uncover urban crime trends and assess the impact of various factors on neighborhood dynamics.


Overview


The Urban Insights project is a data-driven analysis aimed at understanding urban crime dynamics and evaluating the impact of various factors on neighborhood safety and rehabilitation efforts. This repository contains code for parsing crime data, calculating crime rates by year and neighborhood, and exploring correlations with additional factors such as vacant building notices and rehabilitation efforts. Statistical tests and visualizations are employed to uncover trends and assess the influence of these factors on urban crime dynamics.
